A hydrologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.
My interests include groundwater modeling, optimization techniques,
[infographics](/art/2012/05/31/infographics/), and
[software development](https://github.com/popstrider).
See [curriculum vitae](/cv.html) for
additional information. A tutorial on building this blog is available
[here](/lessons/2012/05/30/jekyll-build-on-windows/).
